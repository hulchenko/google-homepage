This is the first Odin Project dedicated to Google Homepage.
As per the task, I was required to create a Google looking page, however, I decided to use some creativity and to mimic as much animation and responsiveness from the page, as possible.
P.S. The page is taken from the Canadian default Google page. I've logged out on purpose to match it :)
Hope you'll enjoy!
